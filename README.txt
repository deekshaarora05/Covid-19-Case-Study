Shell scripts and json files:
   1.1	   neighbor-districts-modified.json    Contains list of neighbors of a district
   1.2	   case-generator.sh                   Finds total number of cases for each district in a week/month/overall
   1.3	   edge-generator.sh                   Finds the neighbor of each district and output it in an edge-list format
   1.4	   neighbor-generator.sh               Finds the average and standard deviation of the number of cases in the neighboring districts
   1.5	   state-generator.sh                  Finds the average and standard deviation of the number of cases in all other districts in the state

2. Steps to run the program:

   2.1 	Please install python 3.6 (or higher) using:
			$ sudo apt-get install python3.6
   2.2 	Additional python packages needed to be installed:
			pandas - $ pip install pandas
			numpy - $ pip install numpy
   2.3 	To run the program from the top, a separate script is provided. Please run assign1.sh. To run some individual program, please 				run the shell scripts in the top down order as listed in section 1.1 as some programs require supporting files which will be 				generated by some predecessing program.
			$ ./assign1.sh
   2.4 	To run .py programs, please use:
			$ python3 'filename'.py
   2.5	To view neighbor-districts-modified.json:
			$ cat neighbor-districts-modified.json
   2.6	Dependencies among the programs:
	 2.6.1	edge-generator.sh uses the file: 
			->"mapping.csv" generated by case-generator.sh

	 2.6.2	neighbor-generator.sh uses the files: 
			->"dic_week.json", "dic_month.json", "dic_overall.json", "cases-week.csv", "cases-month.csv" and "cases-overall.csv" 					generated by case-generator.sh. 
			->"district_neighbors.json" generated by edge-generator.sh

	 2.6.3	state-generator.sh uses the files:
			->"mapping.csv", "dic_month.json", "dic_overall.json","cases-week.csv", "cases-month.csv" and "cases-overall.csv" 					generated by case-generator.sh

	 2.6.4	zscore-genertor.sh uses the files:
			->"cases-week.csv", "cases-month.csv" and "cases-overall.csv" generated by case-generator.sh
			->"neighbor-week.csv","neighbor-month.csv","neighbor-overall.csv" generated by neighbor-generator.sh
			->"state-week.csv","state-month.csv","state-overall.csv" generated by state-generator.sh

	 2.6.5	method-spot-generator.sh uses the files:
			->"dic_week.json", "dic_month.json", "dic_overall.json", "cases-week.csv", "cases-month.csv" and "cases-overall.csv" 				   generated by case-generator.sh
			->"neighbor-week.csv","neighbor-month.csv","neighbor-overall.csv" generated by neighbor-generator.sh
			->"state-week.csv","state-month.csv","state-overall.csv" generated by state-generator.sh

	 2.6.6	top-generator.sh uses the files:
			->"zscore-week.csv","zscore-month.csv","zscore-overall.csv" generated by zscore-generator.sh

3. Program runtime:
	The optimistic runtime of the program when run from the top (assign1.sh) is - 2 minutes. Please allow the kernel to run for this time.
